                        This book talks about how it’s going in the school in Colonial America. Here, students ranged in age from 4 to 20 years
                        old, when their parents needed them to work at home, they did not go to school. Many students did chores before school,
                        went to school from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., did more chores, and then played afterward. Education nowadays is way more
                        different than back in time, poorer students usually skipped school to enter an apprenticeship while rich students had
                        private tutoring and others attended dame schools. However, in colonial times, most people did not believe girls needed
                        further education. Girls learned enough reading, writing, and arithmetic to be able to study the Bible and manage family
                        finances. Many students at that time got depression and anxiety attacked by their school punishments, they were punished
                        harshly. They got whipped or they were hit by a switch. If they forgot their lessons, they had to sit in the corner with
                        a dunce cap on their head. This and every other book in the series “It's Back to School ... Way Back!” describes some
                        aspect of colonial school life. This certainly wasn't riveting information, but for a young reader, this would be the
                        lesson.

                        Chapter 5 is our favorite part. This chapter will talk about how a day in school at colonial will be. First, the
                        schoolmasters separated colonial students into several classes. The children will according to their same level class,
                        also by this chapter we know that at that time the books are very rare and expensive so the students protect it's really
                        carefully. By some ways example like using a thumb paper to protect it’s. All the children will that time start a day
                        with a bible reading, then the older students will start to learn with a book called New England Paper and the younger
                        children will study from hornbooks. Hornbooks are wooden study boards shaped like a paddle. On it was printed the ABCs,
                        the lord prayer, a reading lesson and a few simple sentences. Next to that we will know Penmanship was the most
                        important subject in colonial schools. That lesson will use the quill pen by cutting the ends of goose quills at an
                        angle. Because of this lesson in colonial schools the feather pens are really important so the main teachers of each
                        class have to spend a few hours or it could be a whole day to fix the pen to the perfect form. much children at that
                        time often learning to write on the books called “copybooks” All the children in the class will be learning to write on
                        the line that has been prepare before that. The last thing that we learn in chapter 5 is many grammar schools are also
                        taught by the students arithmetic. Most colonial children didn’t own their printed arithmetic books. Early arithmetic
                        books will just have by the headteacher allowed to consult. For fear of being curious about a school day in the past so
                        this will be our favorite chap.

                       <b>What we like</b>: What we really love about this book is that it is very helpful, they talk very deeply about how students studied at their school and with amazing historical accuracy, you guys should try this once
<br>
<b>What We Learned</b>: This book has a lot of lessons that everyone can get after reading, but to talk about what I have really learned is gratitude, we should feel grateful for being born in a civilized age, regardless of class, and we should appreciate what we have.
<br>
<b>Our opinion</b>: We think that because there is so much information so it can be confusing and hard to read.
